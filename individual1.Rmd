```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)
hist(choco$Rating, main= 'Histogram of Cholocate Ratings', xlab = 'Rating Value', ylab= 'Frequency')
boxplot(choco$Rating, main='Boxplot of Chocolate Ratings', ylab="Rating Value")
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating, xlab='Cacao Percentage', ylab='Chocolate Rating')
```

###Question 1
There is a mostly normal distribution of the ratings data, perhaps a little right skew. As for outliers, the boxplot suggests there are 4.

###Question 2
There is a weak correlation between cacao percent and rating, as most of the chocolate is between 60 and 80 percent cacao, however the ratings are varied.
